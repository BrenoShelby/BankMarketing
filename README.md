# BankMarketing
The data is related with direct marketing campaigns (phone calls) of a Portuguese banking institution. The classification goal is to predict if the client will subscribe a term deposit (variable y).
I preprocessed the features and then I used classification models to find the best solutions based on the business problem, for each model I used metrics such as accuracy, recall, precision and ROC AUC Score. However, I not made a deep data analysis, because the only purpose been to predict if the client will subscribe a term deposit or don't.

This dataset is based on "Bank Marketing" UCI dataset (please check the description at: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing).
